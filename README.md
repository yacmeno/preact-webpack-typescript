# Preact boilerplate

## What's this

This is a very simple repo that features a setup to play around with Preact.

It features:

- Typescript
- Webpack
- SASS

The Preact templates used by preact-cli are more complete and optimized, but also more obscure in the way they work. This was made to experiment with the build setup.
